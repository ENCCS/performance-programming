Instructor's guide
------------------

This is the suggested amount of time that one should spend at each module when teaching. 

.. csv-table::
   :widths: auto
   :delim: ;

   1h 30min ; :doc:`algorithms`
   1h 45min ; :doc:`compilers`
   4h       ; :doc:`architecture`
   4h       ; :doc:`tuning`

   Plenty of time should be reserved for the setup as well but how much time largely depends on the amount of students in the course.
